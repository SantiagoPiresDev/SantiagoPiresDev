- Hi! I'm a junior/senior developer (lot of years without programming, just living without problems! I'm starting again to try to develop some AR Applications.
- I used to write on C, Visual Basic, .net and VBscript, now comming back for some JavaScript, C++, C# and more...
- Programming is like magic. Writting very specific instructions in arcane languages to invoke commands, and if you get a little bit wrong you risk to unleashing demons 
and destroying everything.
- Still turning coffee into Code.
- I'm in love with blender (both, the 3d program and the one to made nice cocktails)
